            <h5>Technologist / Owner</h5>
            
            <p>
                With over 15 years of experience (gained working for various multi-national businesses spanning a variety industries and roles - all related to technology & improving business operations), I have a unique insight into the role that technology plays in helping businesses to grow and evolve. 
            </p>

            

            <p>
                Through this experience I have come to value:
            </p>

            <ul>
                
                <li>evolotion over revolution</li>
                <li>relationships over contracts</li>
                <li>curiosity over historical ways of working</li>
            
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                * note - this is not to say that I do not value the items on the right, rather, I place more emphasis on the items on the left.

                Knowing when to zoom-in into the technical details, or when to keep focussed on the bigger picture, is essential.
