        <p>I work with organizations of all sizes to help them with things like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>unlocking insights from existing data</li>
            <li>analysing existing 'as-is' business
            <li>managing complex or messy projects</li>
            <li>turning ideas into working proof-of-concepts</li>
            <li>training teams on how to use their tools more effectively</li>
        </ul> 
            
        <p>With a mix of technical skills and business experience, I provide a variety of services that many businesses do not have 'in-house'.</p>

        <p>Whether you just need an extra brain on a project, or you have an idea that you're desparate to try but don't know where to start, I'm here to help you get where you want to go.</p>
        
        <p>No jargon, no fluff, just focused support to help move things forward.</p>
