            <p>
                I help organizations of all sizes with things like:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>unlocking insights from existing data</li>
                <li>analysing existing 'as-is' business
                <li>managing complex or messy projects</li>
                <li>turning ideas into working proof-of-concepts</li>
                <li>training teams on how to use their tools more effectively</li>
            </ul> 
                
            <p>
                With a mix of technical skills and business experience, I provide a variety of services that many businesses do not have 'in-house'.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>
