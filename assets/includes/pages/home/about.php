        <h4>Helping clients make better use of their data, tools, and ideas.</h4>
         
        <p>Not every business has the time, headcount, or know-how to take on digital projects in-house.</p>

        <p>That’s where I come in. I work with organizations of all sizes to help them with things like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>unlocking insights from existing data</li>
            <li>managing complex or messy projects</li>
            <li>turning ideas into working proof-of-concepts</li>
            <li>training teams on how to use their tools more effectively</li>
        </ul> 
            
        <p>I have a mix of technical skills, business sense, and a practical mindset — gained through two decades of using technology to solve business problems.</p>
        
        <p>No jargon, no fluff, just focused support to help move things forward.</p>

        <p>Whether you're working through a tricky challenge or just need an extra brain on a project, I.m here to help you get where you want to go.</p>

        <p>Check out the 'Case Studies' section to see some examples of how I have been able to help my clients.</p>
