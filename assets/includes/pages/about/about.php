        <h1>ABOUT</h1>

        <p>We help businesses make better use of their data, tools, and ideas.</p>

        <p>Not every business has the time, headcount, or know-how to take on digital projects in-house.</p>

        <p>That’s where we come in. We work with organizations of all sizes to help them with things like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>unlocking insights from existing data</li>
            <li>managing complex or messy projects</li>
            <li>turning ideas into working proof-of-concepts</li>
            <li>training teams on how to use their tools more effectively</li>
        </ul> 
            
        <p>We have a mix of technical skill, business sense, and a practical mindset — no jargon, no fluff, just focused support to help move things forward.</p>

        <p>Whether you're working through a tricky challenge or just need an extra brain on a project, we’re here to help you get where you’re going.</p>

        <p>We are based in Hull (East Yorkshire) but have national scope, so wherever you are in the UK, please feel free to give us a call to discuss how we can help you.</p>
